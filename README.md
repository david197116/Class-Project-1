This App consist of 3 API's one to search for food, another one for drinks and the Google map api to search for location.
User enter the ingridients they will like to use and it provides the top 10 Recipes with those items from the food APU. The Drinks API only allows to serach for one item using the free subscription. The Google Maps API lets the user finds the nearest groceries store from the current location. The Application is functional but is missing some additional features we were working on.
